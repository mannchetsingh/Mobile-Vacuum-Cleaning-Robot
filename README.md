# Mobile-Vacuum-Cleaning-Robot
We engineered and constructed a cost-effective, app-controlled vacuum cleaner utilizing Arduino and readily available materials. The project aimed to foster affordability, sustainability, and hands-on learning by integrating essential components like an Arduino Uno, a 12V Li-ion battery, a Bluetooth module (HC-05), a motor driver (L298N H-Bridge), three DC motors, and a plastic bottle chassis. The Bluetooth connectivity enabled remote control via a smartphone, providing a practical and interactive approach to household cleaning automation.

The robot's design is centered around the Arduino Uno, which serves as the system's brain, managing inputs from the Bluetooth module and sensors, and controlling the motor driver for movement and suction. The flowchart and circuit diagrams meticulously outline the process, from initializing the Arduino and establishing Bluetooth connectivity to executing commands for movement and suction adjustments. The vacuum cleaner is equipped with a propeller and wheels attached to a plastic bottle, making it lightweight and maneuverable, ideal for navigating and cleaning various surfaces.

This project underscores my skills in robotics, programming, and electronic circuit design. It not only demonstrates my ability to create innovative solutions with limited resources but also emphasizes the importance of sustainability in engineering. The mobile vacuum cleaning robot represents a blend of technology and creativity, showcasing how simple materials can be transformed into a functional and efficient cleaning device. This endeavor highlights my commitment to practical, cost-effective, and eco-friendly engineering solutions.
